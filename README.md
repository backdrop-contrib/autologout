# Automated Logout

This module provides a site administrator with the ability to set
the system to log users out after a specified time of inactivity.
It is highly customisable and includes "site policies" per role to
set different timeouts for each role. It is also possible to allow
users to set their own personal values.

After a given timeout has passed, users are given a
configurable session-expired prompt. They can reset the timeout,
logout, or ignore it in which case they'll be logged out after
the padding time has elapsed. This is all backed up by a
server side logout if js is disable or bypassed.

This is a port from the Drupal module of the same name, v7.x-4.4,
with some additions to provide the per role and per user
optional settings.

## Status

This is a revised and working release (1.x-4.5.x). I am very 
grateful for the work done by Herbdool in identifying and
fixing some issues present in the initial releases. (1.x-4.4.x).

## Features

  + Different timeouts based on role
  + Disabling of timeouts based on role
  + Permission for users to set their own timeout
  + Includes some JS mechanisms to keep uses logged in even if
    multiple tabs are open or if the user is working on a form
    for a long period of time.
  + Includes developer hooks to allow users to remain logged in
    depending on your own project specific requirements
  + Optional integration with Javascript Timer
